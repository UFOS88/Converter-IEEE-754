# Converter-IEEE-754
The program implements the IEEE 754 standard in python. The algorithm supports both single-precision and double-precision transformations.

# How to use the Interface
The first thing to do is to instantiate an object of the IEEE754 () class. The class constructor takes the precision of the transformation (FLOAT32 / DOUBLE64) as a parameter. By default, the transformation is done with single precision (FLOAT32). To convert, call the convert () method and pass the number to convert.
